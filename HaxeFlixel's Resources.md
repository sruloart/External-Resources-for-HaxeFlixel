#### This is a WIP list that I've made a few weeks ago for HaxeFlixel and didn't have time to complete. Maybe someone can use it as it is. 
- Updates may follow. 
- ```Entry's Name ([Author](Author's link))](Entry's link):``` is the markdown template I use for entries, this is why you have this guy (): all over the document. 
- This document is built for easy browsing, so expect entries to repeat themselves when it's needed. 


```
title: "External Libraries and Services"
```

# Introduction
When you are building your game you want to have the ability to extend its capabilites beyond what HaxeFlixel/OpenFL supports. This requires you to interact with many external libraries and services, which may only allow you to do so through their [API](http://www.techterms.com/definition/api)'s or [RTE](http://www.techterms.com/definition/rte)'s. 

It may seem like a scary task at first, but luckily, there's a good chance some good people (such as [Johann Martinache](https://github.com/shoebox), [Sergey Miryanov](https://github.com/sergey-miryanov) and [Emiliano Angelini](https://github.com/emibap)) did most of the work for you; writing code that allows you to use these libraries and services within your own project at (relative) ease. 

Some of these resources are already written in Haxe, so frequently it's just a matter of [using Haxelib](http://haxeflixel.com/documentation/using-haxelib/) with the quite comfortable [list of available libraries to install](http://lib.haxe.org/), but some of them are written in a variety of languages, which makes it a bit more complicated to deal with, so let us start with those:

# Non-Haxe libraries and services

## How does it work?

### OpenFL native extensions


### JAVA

### AS3 (Action-Script)

#### Convert AS3 to Haxe

#### Use Haxe with AS3 


### C++

## Native Targets 

### Android
#### Hardware

[Barcode ([Barak Shohat](http://www.bazzisoft.com/index.php))](https://github.com/bazzisoft-openfl-extensions/barcode):This extension provides real-time barcode scanning functionality for iOS and Android, directly from the device's camera. In Android, it uses the Google/ZXing Barcode Scanner app as a service. This app must be installed separately for barcode scanning to work. The extension provides an indication if it's not installed when attempting to scan.

[GetImagExt [(Ipsilon Developments Inc.)](http://www.ipsilondev.com/)](https://github.com/ipsilondev/getimagext): Get the full path of an image, taken from camera or selected in the gallery by the user.in android, it can also get resources from any other media app

[Interop ([Barak Shohat](http://www.bazzisoft.com/index.php))](https://github.com/bazzisoft-openfl-extensions/interop): Launch your iOS/Android app via a URL with parameters. This extension provides functionality for launching other apps via a URL, and detecting when this app is launched by a URL with a custom scheme. This can be useful for integrating with 3rd party apps or integrating to & from a website.

[Mail Sender([Emiliano Angelini](https://github.com/emibap))](https://github.com/emibap/mailSender): 

[Mobile Display ([Barak Shohat](http://www.bazzisoft.com/index.php))](https://github.com/bazzisoft-openfl-extensions/mobiledisplay): Manage the mobile display & detect virtual keyboard appearance. This extension provides functionality for managing the display of mobile devices. Currently this includes:

- Detecting and triggering events when the virtual keyboard pops up & down.
- Simulating a soft keyboard display element for non-mobile devices.

### iOS
[Barcode ([Barak Shohat](http://www.bazzisoft.com/index.php))](https://github.com/bazzisoft-openfl-extensions/barcode): This extension provides real-time barcode scanning functionality for iOS and Android, directly from the device's camera. In iOS, it uses the ZBarSDK (http://zbar.sourceforge.net/iphone/) and the scanner is integrated as a view inside the app.

### Small Devices
https://github.com/AlexHaxe/hxL8: is a command line application to talk to the L8 smartlight via USB

### OUYA

### Windows

## Platform API
### IOS
[Hxgk-Flixel](https://github.com/prestia/hxgk-flixel) [`(Anthony Prestia)`](http://anthonyprestia.com/): A modified hxgk that adds Game Center support to HaxeFlixel projects. The options for integrating Game Center into HaxeFlixel projects are not great. The original HxGK project seems to have largely disappeared from the Internet and NMEX, while full of great features, is an absolute pain to get running in its current state. This project should, hopefully, make basic Game Center integration (leaderboards and achievements) much simpler.

[Game Center](https://github.com/openfl/gamecenter) [`(OpenFl)`](https://github.com/openfl)

[Game Center](https://github.com/sergey-miryanov/gamecenter) [`(Sergey Miryanov)`](https://github.com/sergey-miryanov)

[IAP](https://github.com/openfl/iap) [`(OpenFl)`](https://github.com/openfl): Provides an access to in-app purchases (iOS) and in-app billing (android) for OpenFL projects, using a common API.

### Facebook

#### Windows and Flash

#### Mobile (Android + iOS)
[HypFacebook](https://github.com/hyperfiction/HypFacebook)

### Google Play
[Linden Google Play](https://github.com/sergey-miryanov/linden-google-play) [`(Sergey Miryanov)`](https://github.com/sergey-miryanov): Android extension for OpenFL for GooglePlay services like Achievements, Leaderboards, etc. [Demo here](https://github.com/sergey-miryanov/linden-samples).

[IAP](https://github.com/openfl/iap) [`(OpenFl)`](https://github.com/openfl): Provides an access to in-app purchases (iOS) and in-app billing (android) for OpenFL projects, using a common API.

### Kaltura
Kaltura’s open source platform includes hundreds of REST-based application programming interfaces (APIs) providing programmable access to every core service of the platform. With full access to our API*, you can independently extend every feature and functionality of the Kaltura Platform. This means you’ll be able to seamlessly integrate Kaltura’s various solutions, services, and widgets to create a unified experience within your chosen environments - be it a known CMS, or custom in-house application.
[KalturaHaxe [Jean-Baptiste Richardet](http://www.knowledge-players.com)] (https://github.com/Knowledge-Players/KalturHaxe):

### Ouya Market
Ouya is a 99$ game-console that is based on custom Android OS, Tegra 3, and a native controller (with support to other mainstream controllers). The console have a relatively small game market,     

	
[Openfl-OUYA ([Jushoa Granick '''at''' OpenFL](https://github.com/jgranick))](https://github.com/openfl/openfl-ouya):

### Steam Store
Steam, the giant game store that is beloved anywhere but the lairs of pure evil, so it seems. Every game maker wants to be greenlighted into steam, and many would sell their grandmothers' cats to be featured on it for a day. Still, even when you are lucky enough to get in, you still need to integrate Steam's unique C++ based API into your game.

#### Android

#### iOS
[Twixel ([Anthony Prestia](http://anthonyprestia.com/))](https://github.com/prestia/twixel) (HaxeFlixel):An openfl extension that adds the ability to use Tweet Sheets from within iOS applications. Includes a sample HaxeFlixel project. This extension currently supports multiple accounts, basic tweets, and fancy iOS-style URL appends. I will likely add image support in the future. This extension also uses the newer iOS Social framework and can potentially support Facebook in the future. Most of the existing Haxe extensions use the deprecated Twitter framework.

# HaxeFlixel/OpenFL/Haxe Games' Sources
There is a growing number of free games sources written with HaxeFlixel/OpenFL/Haxe available online for you to learn from. So far no one has made a proper list of them, so, let us change that shall we? There is one big caveat though: the vast majority of such games is outdated, so there's a good chance you will not be able to run it right out the box. However, that's really O.K because tinkering with the code is what makes you learn, eventually.

[HaxeFlixel Godot Parser([Pekka Heikkinen](https://github.com/volvis))](https://github.com/volvis/HaxeFlixel-Godot_Parser): Experimental tools for reading Godot scenes into HaxeFlixel.HaxeFlixel lacks a common IDE for managing objects. Godot, while a fully functional game engine, is at the time of writing still in its infancy. However the IDE offers plenty of attractive tools for content authoring. The idea here is to read in Godot scene files, which can be saved as plain text XML, and recreate the Node2D items in HaxeFlixel.

## HaxeFlixel Templates
There is a great number of repeating game related Classes that every game needs, but right now you need to create from scratch if you use HaxeFlixel, a practice that is not very useful or efficient. This list represent some of them, so in the future these classes can become a part of HaxeFlixel through a templates folder.
